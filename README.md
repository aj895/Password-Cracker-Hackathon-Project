We were inspired to make this program due to the rise in cyber attacks as of recently. We believe this program can help to educated people on the **importance of 
having a strong password**. The program gives the user two hints about a person, such as their cat's name and the month they were born in. From there, the user 
enters phrases such as "whiskers12" until they guess the password correctly. We built the program in java by creating a Keyword class to hold a hint and half 
of the password. From there, we made an ArrayList to hold over 25 unique Keyword classes. The game began by randomly selecting two of the classes and combining 
their password pieces together, allowing for **far over 300 unique combinations**. It gives the user 2 hints, one for each part, and the user guesses from there.
